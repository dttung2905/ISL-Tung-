    "- Subset selection : Identify a subset of the p predictors that we believe to be related to the repsonse . \n",
    "- Shrinkage. Fit a model involving all p predictors. However,the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. This shrinkage has the effect on reducing the variance . Depending on waht type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients maya be estimated to be exactly zero. Hence, shrinkage methods can also peform variable selection\n",
    "- Dimension Reduction: project the p predictors into a M-dimensional subspace , where M ,<p . This is achieve by computing M different linear combinations , or projections , of the variables. Then these M projections "
